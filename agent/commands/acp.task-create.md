## What This Command Does

This command creates a new task file with proper structure, milestone linking, and automatic updates to progress.yaml. It provides a guided workflow for creating well-structured tasks that follow ACP conventions.

**Key Features**:
- Milestone-aware (links to current or specified milestone)
- Automatic task numbering
- Draft file support with clarification workflow
- Auto-updates progress.yaml with new task
- Uses task-1-{title}.template.md as base

**Use this when**: Creating a new task in an ACP project.

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] ACP installed in current directory
- [ ] Task template exists (agent/tasks/task-1-{title}.template.md)
- [ ] progress.yaml exists with at least one milestone
- [ ] (Optional) Draft file prepared if using draft workflow

---

## Steps

### 1. Detect Current Milestone

Determine which milestone this task belongs to:

**Actions**:
- Read progress.yaml
- Identify current milestone (current_milestone field)
- Get milestone details (name, ID)
- Ask user to confirm or select different milestone

**Expected Outcome**: Target milestone identified

### 2. Determine Task Number

Find the next available task number:

**Actions**:
- List all existing task files in agent/tasks/
- Parse task numbers (task-1-*, task-2-*, etc.)
- Find highest number
- Increment by 1 for new task number

**Expected Outcome**: Next task number determined (e.g., task-25)

### 3. Check for Draft File

Check if draft file was provided as argument:

**Syntax**:
- `@acp.task-create @my-draft.md` (@ reference)
- `@acp.task-create agent/drafts/my-draft.md` (path)
- `@acp.task-create` (no draft)

**Actions**:
- If draft provided: Read draft file
- If no draft: Proceed to Step 4

**Expected Outcome**: Draft file read (if provided)

### 4. Collect Task Information

Gather information from user via chat:

**Information to Collect**:
- **Task name** (descriptive, without "Task N:" prefix)
  - Example: "Implement User Authentication" (not "Task 25: Implement User Authentication")
  - Validation: Clear, action-oriented
- **Task description** (objective - what this task accomplishes)
  - Example: "Implement Firebase Authentication with email/password and Google sign-in"
- **Estimated time** (hours or days)
  - Example: "4-6 hours" or "2 days"
- **Dependencies** (other tasks that must complete first)
  - Example: "Task 24" or "None"
- **Context** (background information)
  - Example: "Authentication is required before implementing user-scoped data"

**If no draft provided**:
- Ask: "Describe what you want this task to accomplish" OR
- Offer: "Would you like to create an empty draft file first?"

**Expected Outcome**: All task metadata collected

### 5. Process Draft (If Provided)

If draft file was provided, create clarification if needed:

**Actions**:
- Analyze draft for clarity and completeness
- If draft is clear and complete: Skip clarification, use draft content
- If draft is ambiguous: Create clarification document
  - Find next clarification number
  - Create `agent/clarifications/clarification-{N}-task-{name}.md`
  - Generate questions about unclear aspects
  - Wait for user to answer clarification
  - Read answered clarification

**Expected Outcome**: Clarification created and answered (if needed)

### 6. Generate Task File

Create task file from template:

**Actions**:
- Determine full filename: `task-{N}-{name}.md`
  - N = task number from Step 2
  - name = kebab-case version of task name
- Copy from task template (agent/tasks/task-1-{title}.template.md)
- Fill in metadata:
  - Task number and name
  - Milestone link
  - Estimated time
  - Dependencies
  - Status: "Not Started"
- Fill in sections:
  - Objective (from collected info)
  - Context (from collected info or draft)
  - Steps (from draft/clarification or template structure)
  - Verification checklist
- Save to `agent/tasks/task-{N}-{name}.md`

**Expected Outcome**: Task file created

### 7. Update progress.yaml

Add task to progress.yaml:

**Actions**:
- Read progress.yaml
- Find the milestone section (e.g., milestone_4)
- Add new task entry:
  ```yaml
  - id: task-{N}
    name: {Task Name}
    status: not_started
    file: agent/tasks/task-{N}-{name}.md
    estimated_hours: {hours}
    completed_date: null
    notes: |
      {Brief description or empty}
  ```
- Update milestone tasks_total count
- Save progress.yaml

**Expected Outcome**: progress.yaml updated with new task

### 8. Prompt to Delete Draft (If Used)

If draft file was used, ask to delete it:

**Actions**:
- Ask: "Would you like to delete the draft file? (yes/no)"
- If yes: Delete draft file
- If no: Keep draft file

**Expected Outcome**: User chooses whether to keep draft

### 9. Report Success

Display what was created:

**Output**:
```
✅ Task Created Successfully!

File: agent/tasks/task-{N}-{name}.md
Task Number: {N}
Milestone: M{X} - {Milestone Name}
Estimated Time: {hours}
Status: Not Started

✓ Task file created
✓ progress.yaml updated
✓ Draft file deleted (if requested)

Next steps:
- Review and refine task steps
- Add verification items
- Start working with @acp.proceed
```

**Expected Outcome**: User knows task was created successfully

## Examples

### Example 1: Creating Task for Current Milestone

**Context**: Working on Milestone 3, need to add a new task

**Invocation**: `@acp.task-create`

**Interaction**:
```
Agent: Current milestone: M3 - ACP Package Management System
Agent: Create task for this milestone? (yes/no)
User: yes

Agent: What would you like to name your task?
User: Implement Package Search Command

Agent: Provide a description (what this task accomplishes):
User: Create @acp.package-search command to discover ACP packages via GitHub API

Agent: Estimated time? (e.g., "4 hours", "2 days")
User: 6-8 hours

Agent: Dependencies? (other task numbers or "None")
User: Task 10

Agent: Any additional context?
User: Needs GitHub API integration for repository search

✅ Task Created Successfully!

File: agent/tasks/task-11-package-search-command.md
Task Number: 11
Milestone: M3 - ACP Package Management System
Estimated Time: 6-8 hours
Status: Not Started

✓ Task file created
✓ progress.yaml updated
```

### Example 2: Creating Task with Draft

**Context**: Have draft file describing task

**Invocation**: `@acp.task-create @my-task-draft.md`

**Result**: Reads draft, creates clarification if needed, generates task, updates progress.yaml

### Example 3: Creating Task for Different Milestone

**Context**: Want to add task to future milestone

**Invocation**: `@acp.task-create`

**Interaction**:
```
Agent: Current milestone: M3 - ACP Package Management System
Agent: Create task for this milestone? (yes/no)
User: no

Agent: Available milestones:
  - M1: ACP Commands Infrastructure (completed)
  - M2: Documentation & Utility Commands (completed)
  - M3: ACP Package Management System (in progress)
  - M4: Package Development System (not started)

Agent: Which milestone? (enter ID like "M4")
User: M4

[Continues with task creation for M4...]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: No milestones found

**Symptom**: Error message "No milestones found in progress.yaml"

**Solution**: Create a milestone first using milestone template, or add milestone to progress.yaml manually

### Issue 2: Invalid task name

**Symptom**: Task name rejected

**Solution**: Use descriptive, action-oriented names. Avoid special characters except hyphens.

### Issue 3: progress.yaml update failed

**Symptom**: Error updating progress.yaml

**Solution**: Verify progress.yaml exists and is valid YAML. Check milestone section exists for target milestone.

### Issue 4: Task number conflict

**Symptom**: Task file already exists with that number

**Solution**: Command should auto-detect and use next available number. If conflict persists, manually check agent/tasks/ directory.

## Security Considerations

### File Access
- **Reads**: progress.yaml, draft files, task templates, milestone documents
- **Writes**: agent/tasks/task-{N}-{name}.md, progress.yaml
- **Executes**: None

### Network Access
- **APIs**: None
- **Repositories**: None

### Sensitive Data
- **Secrets**: Never include secrets in tasks
- **Credentials**: Never include credentials

---

## Notes

- Task name should be action-oriented (start with verb)
- Task number is automatically assigned (sequential)
- Tasks are always created as "Not Started" status
- Draft files can be any format (free-form markdown)
- Clarifications are created only if draft is ambiguous
- progress.yaml is automatically updated
- Task is linked to milestone via file path and progress.yaml entry
- Estimated time helps with milestone planning
