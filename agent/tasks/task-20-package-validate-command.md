## Objective

Implement comprehensive package validation with shell-based and LLM-based checks, auto-fix capabilities, test installation, and remote availability verification.

## Context

From clarifications:
- Shell validation (structure, files, git)
- LLM validation (content quality)
- Test installation to /tmp (default behavior)
- Remote availability check
- Auto-fix with user choice (all at once or step-by-step)
- Output in chat window
