**Priority**: high  
**Milestone**: M17 (Artifact Commands System)  
**Design Reference**: [Artifact Commands System](../../design/local.artifact-commands-system.md)  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Started**: 2026-03-17  
**Completed**: 2026-03-17

## Objective

Create template files for the three artifact types (research, glossary, reference) that will be used by the artifact creation commands to generate high-quality, consistent artifacts.

---

## Requirements

1. Create `agent/artifacts/` directory
2. Create `research.template.md` with 6 core + 9 optional sections
3. Create `glossary.template.md` with category tables + alphabetical index
4. Create `reference.template.md` with command-first principle check
5. All templates must include metadata block (Created, Last Verified, Status, Confidence, Category, Sources)

---

## Implementation

### Directory Structure

```
agent/
├── artifacts/
│   ├── research.template.md
│   ├── glossary.template.md
│   └── reference.template.md
```

### Research Template

**Core sections (always included):**
1. Metadata Block
2. Executive Summary (100-300 words)
3. Research Context (why, what questions, scope)
4. Key Findings (bullets with citation + confidence)
5. Detailed Analysis (in-depth exploration by topic)
6. Sources & References (all URLs with access dates)

**Optional sections (when relevant):**
7. Recommendations (ranked by priority/confidence)
8. Code Examples (inline snippets with version annotations)
9. Comparison Matrix (side-by-side tables)
10. Integration Notes (how tech integrates with project)
11. Limitations & Gaps (known unknowns)
12. Migration Path (steps to adopt)
13. Security & Compliance (security, licenses, regulatory)
14. Performance Benchmarks (external benchmark data)
15. Community & Support (GitHub stars, response time)

**Verification format per finding:**
```markdown
**Finding**: [Statement with version/date]  
- **Source**: [Exact URL] (accessed YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Confidence**: High (9/10)
- **Verification**:
  - Cross-referenced with [source B]
  - Tested claim against [official docs v2.1.0]
  - Confirmed by [community discussion]
- **How to verify**: [Step-by-step reproducible process]
```

### Glossary Template

**Structure:**
1. Metadata Block
2. Purpose statement
3. Category-grouped tables (Term | Definition)
4. Alphabetical Index (A-Z with category references)
5. Related Documents section

**Example category table:**
```markdown
## Architecture

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **API Gateway** | Central entry point that routes requests to microservices |
| **Microservice** | Self-contained service with single responsibility |
```

### Reference Template

**Structure:**
1. Metadata Block
2. Purpose statement (what this reference covers, when to use)
3. Command-First Principle Check (explicit check: "Could this be a command?")
4. Content section (varies by reference type)
5. Sources & References
6. Related Documents

**Supported reference types:**
- Configuration tables (environment variables, feature flags)
- CLI syntax (Git, Docker, SQL)
- Standards/conventions (code style, commit format)
- Architecture diagrams (service maps, data flows)
- Data schemas (database ER diagrams, file formats)
- Troubleshooting guides (diagnostic decision trees)
- API/protocol contracts (API formats, message schemas)

---

## Testing

### Validation Checks

- [x] All three template files created
- [x] `research.template.md` contains all 6 core sections
- [x] `research.template.md` contains all 9 optional sections marked as optional
- [x] `glossary.template.md` has category tables + alphabetical index
- [x] `reference.template.md` has command-first principle check
- [x] All templates have metadata block with required fields
- [x] All templates have proper markdown structure

### Manual Review

- [x] Templates follow design document specifications
- [x] Metadata fields match defined schema
- [x] Section ordering is logical
- [x] Examples are clear and instructive
- [x] Optional sections are clearly marked

---

## Files Created

1. `agent/artifacts/research.template.md` (158 lines)
2. `agent/artifacts/glossary.template.md` (61 lines)
3. `agent/artifacts/reference.template.md` (154 lines)

---

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Directory name | `artifacts/` | Follows existing pattern (e.g., `tasks.template.md/`) |
| Metadata placement | Top of file, before content | Immediate visibility, consistent with other entity types |
| Optional sections | Clearly marked in comments | Prevents bloat, keeps minimal artifacts lightweight |
| Verification format | Structured with confidence + process | Makes research auditable and reproducible |
| Command-first check | Explicit section in reference template | Enforces principle at template level, prevents reference bloat |

---

## Integration Points

- **@acp.artifact-research**: Uses `research.template.md` to generate artifacts
- **@acp.artifact-glossary**: Uses `glossary.template.md` to generate artifacts
- **@acp.artifact-reference**: Uses `reference.template.md` to generate artifacts
- **Template discovery**: Commands search `agent/artifacts/` directory

---

## Notes

Templates designed to enforce quality standards through structure:
- Mandatory metadata fields track staleness (Last Verified)
- Confidence scoring per finding encourages thoroughness
- Citation requirements prevent unsourced claims
- Verification process field makes research reproducible
- Command-first check in reference template reduces bloat

Ready for command implementation (tasks 116-118).
