## Objective

Implement @acp.design-create command that creates design documents with namespace enforcement. Similar to @acp.pattern-create and @acp.command-create.

---

## Context

From clarifications:
- Works like pattern-create and command-create
- Uses design.template.md
- Supports draft files
- Context-aware behavior

---

## Steps

### 1. Create Command Documentation

Create agent/commands/acp.design-create.md following pattern-create structure.

### 2. Implement Script

Create agent/scripts/acp.design-create.sh:
- Reuse logic from pattern-create and command-create
- Use design.template.md

### 3. Test Design Creation

Test all scenarios.

---

## Verification

- [ ] acp.design-create.md created
- [ ] acp.design-create.sh implemented
- [ ] Works in package and project contexts
- [ ] All scenarios tested
