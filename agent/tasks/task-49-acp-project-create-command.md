**Milestone**: M5 - Global Package Installation  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Dependencies**: Task 29 (Global ACP Auto-Initialization)  

---

## Objective

Create the `@acp.project-create` command that enables users to quickly bootstrap new **generic ACP projects** (not packages) in `~/.acp/projects/` with guided setup for project metadata.

---

## Context

Users currently have two ways to start new work:
1. Run `acp.install.sh` in an existing directory (manual)
2. Use `@acp.package-create` (creates **packages** with package.yaml, release branches, pre-commit hooks)

**The Problem**: `@acp.package-create` creates **packages** designed for distribution (with package.yaml, publishing workflow, etc.). But users also need to create **generic projects** - applications, tools, or experiments that use ACP for development but aren't meant to be published as ACP packages.  

**The Solution**: `@acp.project-create` creates **generic ACP projects** without package-specific infrastructure.  

### Key Differences from @acp.package-create

| Feature | @acp.package-create | @acp.project-create |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Purpose** | Create distributable ACP packages | Create generic ACP projects |
| **Creates package.yaml** | ✅ Yes (required for packages) | ❌ No (not a package) |
| **Release branch config** | ✅ Yes (for publishing) | ❌ No (not publishing) |
| **Pre-commit hooks** | ✅ Yes (validates package.yaml) | ❌ No (no package.yaml to validate) |
| **Target location** | `~/.acp/projects/` or custom | `~/.acp/projects/` or custom |
| **README template** | Package-focused (installation, publishing) | Project-focused (development, usage) |
| **Use case** | Sharing patterns/commands with others | Building apps, tools, experiments |

**Both commands**:
- Can create in `~/.acp/projects/` (or any directory)
- Install full ACP (templates, commands, scripts)
- Initialize git repository
- Create README.md and .gitignore

---

## Steps

### 1. Collect Project Information

Gather project metadata via chat:

**Required Information**:
- **Project name** (kebab-case, will be directory name)
  - Example: "my-awesome-app"
  - Validation: lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens only
- **Project description** (one-line summary)
  - Example: "A task management application with AI assistance"
- **Project type** (optional, for context)
  - Options: web-app, cli-tool, library, mcp-server, api, other
  - Used for README template selection

**Optional Information**:
- **Author name** (for documentation)
- **License** (default: MIT)

**Note**: Projects always use the `local` namespace for project-specific commands. Namespace configuration is only available for packages (via `@acp.package-create`).  

### 2. Determine Target Directory

Calculate target directory path:

**Actions**:
- Default: `~/.acp/projects/{project-name}/`
- Expand `~` to `$HOME`
- Validate directory doesn't already exist
- If exists: Ask user to choose different name or confirm overwrite

**Expected Outcome**: Target directory path determined  

### 3. Create Project Directory

Create the project directory structure:

**Actions**:
- Create target directory: `mkdir -p ~/.acp/projects/{project-name}/`
- Verify directory created successfully

**Expected Outcome**: Empty project directory exists  

### 4. Install ACP

Run ACP installation in the new directory:

**Actions**:
- Execute: `cd ~/.acp/projects/{project-name}/ && {path-to-current-acp}/agent/scripts/acp.install.sh`
- Since we're guaranteed to be in an ACP-installed directory, use: `./agent/scripts/acp.install.sh`
- The script should be invoked from the new project directory
- Verify AGENT.md and agent/ directory created
- Verify all templates and scripts installed

**Implementation Note**: The command is invoked from an ACP-installed directory, so `./agent/scripts/acp.install.sh` is always available. The script needs to be executed in the context of the new project directory.  

**Expected Outcome**: Full ACP installation in project directory  

### 5. Create Project README.md

Generate project README with metadata:

**Actions**:
- Create README.md with:
  - Project name as title
  - Description
  - Project type badge (if specified)
  - Quick start section (placeholder)
  - Development section (placeholder)
  - License section
  - ACP attribution link
- Use project-type-specific template if available

**Template**:
```markdown
# {Project Name}

{Description}

> Built with [Agent Context Protocol](https://github.com/prmichaelsen/agent-context-protocol)

## Quick Start

[Add installation and usage instructions]

## Development

This project uses the Agent Context Protocol for development:

- `@acp.init` - Initialize agent context
- `@acp.proceed` - Continue with next task
- `@acp.status` - Check project status

See [AGENT.md](./AGENT.md) for complete documentation.

## License

{License}
```

**Expected Outcome**: README.md created with project metadata  

### 6. Create .gitignore

Create appropriate .gitignore for project:

**Actions**:
- Create .gitignore with common patterns:
  - Node.js patterns (if web-app or api)
  - Python patterns (if applicable)
  - IDE patterns (.vscode/, .idea/)
  - OS patterns (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)
  - Environment files (.env, .env.local)
  - ACP local files (agent/reports/, agent/clarifications/, agent/feedback/)
- Include project-type-specific patterns

**Expected Outcome**: .gitignore created  

### 7. Initialize Git Repository

Set up version control:

**Actions**:
- Run: `git init` in project directory
- Run: `git add .`
- Run: `git commit -m "chore: initialize project with ACP"`
- Verify git repository initialized

**Expected Outcome**: Git repository initialized with initial commit  

### 8. Create Initial progress.yaml

Create minimal progress.yaml for project:

**Actions**:
- Copy from progress.template.yaml
- Fill in project metadata:
  - name: {project-name}
  - version: 0.1.0
  - started: {current-date}
  - status: in_progress
  - description: {project-description}
- Leave milestones and tasks empty (to be planned later)
- Save to agent/progress.yaml

**Expected Outcome**: progress.yaml created with project metadata  

### 9. Display Success Message

Show comprehensive next steps:

**Output**:
```
✅ Project Created Successfully!

Location: ~/.acp/projects/{project-name}/
Project: {project-name}
Description: {description}
Type: {type}

✓ ACP installed (AGENT.md, agent/ directory)
✓ README.md created
✓ .gitignore created
✓ Git repository initialized
✓ progress.yaml created

Next steps:
1. Navigate to project: cd ~/.acp/projects/{project-name}/
2. Define requirements: Edit agent/design/requirements.md
3. Plan milestones: Use @acp.plan to create milestones and tasks
4. Start development: Use @acp.proceed to begin first task

ACP Commands available:
- @acp.init - Initialize context
- @acp.plan - Plan milestones and tasks
- @acp.proceed - Start working
- @acp.status - Check progress

Happy building! 🚀
```

**Expected Outcome**: User knows project was created and how to proceed

## Implementation Notes

### Command File Location
- Create: `agent/commands/acp.project-create.md`
- No shell script needed (LLM-based, like other entity creation commands)

### Similarities to @acp.package-create
- Collects metadata via chat
- Creates directory in standard location
- Runs acp.install.sh for full ACP installation
- Initializes git repository
- Creates README.md

### Differences from @acp.package-create
- **No package.yaml** (projects aren't packages)
- **No release branch** (not publishing to package registry)
- **No pre-commit hook** (not needed for general projects)
- **Simpler .gitignore** (no package-specific patterns)
- **Different README template** (project-focused, not package-focused)
- **Creates in ~/.acp/projects/** (not ~/.acp/packages/)

### Integration with Global ACP
- Leverages init_global_acp() from Task 29
- Ensures ~/.acp/ exists before creating project
- Can reference global packages if needed

### Project Types and Templates

Support different project types with appropriate templates:
- **web-app**: Node.js/TypeScript web application
- **cli-tool**: Command-line tool
- **library**: Reusable library/package
- **mcp-server**: Model Context Protocol server
- **api**: REST/GraphQL API
- **other**: Generic project

Each type can have:
- Type-specific .gitignore patterns
- Type-specific README sections
- Type-specific initial milestones (optional)

---

## Testing
